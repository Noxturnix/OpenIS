## What is OpenIS?

OpenIS is the ~~best Discord bot <abbr title="First working open source Discord bot">in Thailand</abbr>. If you want to grab some codes and put them in your proprietary project then go ahead, this project is [MIT License](#license)'d, and don't forget to put the copyright notice if you are distributing this project~~ **MOST UNSTABLE OPEN SOURCE ANARCHY DISCORD BOT**

## Playground server

If you do not have a server OpenIS or do not want to add the bot to your server, you can join our [playground server](https://discord.gg/dD2Tgh6kJP)

## Add bot to a server

Use this [permissions calculator](https://discordapi.com/permissions.html) to add bot with specific permissions. Use `880996949933838356` as "Client ID"

Or [click here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=880996949933838356&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands) for full permissions (not recommended, as we can't guarantee that someone will put malicious codes in future)
